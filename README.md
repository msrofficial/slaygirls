### **A Very Important Disclaimer**

This is a personal project created **for fun and coding practice**. The content displayed is a curated collection from public sources. **Please do not judge the developer's character based on the content.** It's all in good fun.

Welcome to my top-secret, highly advanced research facility. The subject of our study? How to create the perfect, algorithm-free, endless reel-watching experience.

Tired of Instagram's algorithm deciding what you watch next? Me too. This is my hand-picked collection of premium internet content, served up raw and unfiltered. No suggestions, no ads, just vibes. 🗿

## ✨ What's Inside? (Features)

- **The Endless Loop:** Scroll till the end of time. When the playlist of videos finishes, it just re-shuffles and starts over. The fun never ends.
- **Full-Screen Experience:** Designed to feel like a native app on your phone. No ugly borders, just a pure, immersive view.
- **Satisfying Like Button:** Smash that like button to see the heart turn red. Instant gratification guaranteed.
- **Modern Share Functionality:** Uses the Web Share API on mobile for easy sharing and copies the site link to your clipboard on desktop.
- **My Kingdom, My Rules:** The content is 100% controlled by me via a simple `videos.txt` file. No algorithm can touch this.
- **Linked Socials:** The icons and username link directly to my other corners of the internet.
